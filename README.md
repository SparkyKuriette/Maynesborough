# Maynesborough
A story that doubles as a Python script; it also has a very permissive license.
No contributions to the main branch are allowed, but you may branch off and/or fork the work.
This is a test for writing skills and Python scripting, by the way.
I consider all derivatives to be canon unless they interact with other series in a way that makes at least one thing non-canon, or are explicity marked as non-canon themselves.
